A copy of your Notification will be sent to the person who posted or stored the material addressed in the Notification.

Please note that if you materially misrepresent that the disabled or removed content was removed by mistake or misidentification, you may be liable for damages, including costs and attorney’s fees. Filing a false Counter Notification constitutes perjury.`,
